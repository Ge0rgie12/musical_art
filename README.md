# Musical art

Hi, this is going to be the exam project for a seminar.

Ideas:
- piano music used for generative art 
music —> several curves for frequency etc. —> more than one equation describing the music 
—> use equations for different things (color, background color, kind of figure etc. —> list of styles for example —> use number to select style (maybe use Primfaktorzerlegung))
—> kinda controlled but still generative because random aspect in it 

Problem: how to get equation from musical tone —> use piano sound —> only one note at a time, not a whole song
